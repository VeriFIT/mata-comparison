=======================

Awali is a C++ and Python generic library for weighted finite state machines.

Using Awali
-----------

Awali can be used for the while at four different levels:

- through the *Cora* binary: Cora is a programm that offers many commands to
  compute on automata and transducers.

- as a python module; the `python` directory contains the files to produce
  a module `awalipy` which can be imported into python, ipython or jupyter.

- as a simple C++ library; the `awali/dyn` directory contains headers that
  allow to use Awali without worrying about types. This library uses
  the algorithms of the template library which are compiled on-the-fly
  for the requested type.

- as a template library; the `awali/sttc` directory contains all the
  Awali template library, sometimes called the *static layer*.


History
-------

Awali results from a fork of Vaucanson 2.


Compilation and installation
----------------------------

The *standard* command-line to compile and install Awali are the following.

```
  cd /directory/where/this/README.md/is/located/
  mkdir _build
  cd _build
  cmake ..
  make
  make recommended
  sudo make install
```

This process might not be suitable for your situation.  Details on
requirements, compilation and installation are described in the `INSTALL.md`
file.


Examples and documentation
--------------------------

The documentation of Awali is mostly under construction.

### 1.  Getting started

The directory `awalidoc/GettingStarted` contain files that are a good start for
someone that wants to start using Awali.

The `dyn` subdirectory contains a `first-step.md` file that contains a first 
program and how to compile it.

The `py` and `cora` subdirectories contain jupyter-notebook documents.
Html versions of those documents may be found in the Awali website.


### 2. Examples

- Example programs written in C++ with the static layer of Awali may be found
  in `awali/sttc/examples` (relative to the directory where this `README.md` is
  located).  
  This directory contains an example `Makefile` to compile those programs.

- Example programs written in C++ with the dynamic layer of Awali way be found
  in `awali/dyn/examples` (relative to the directory where this `README.md` is
  located).  
  This directory contains an example `Makefile` to compile those programs.

- Example Python scripts using Awalipy may be found in `awalipy/examples`
  (relative to the directory where this `README.md` is located).


### 3. Documentation

- The C++-level documentation is written with doxygen. You may generate it
  by running the following command from the directory where the `cmake` command
  was executed.
  ```
    make doxygen
  ```
  The generated documentation is made of html pages located in directory
  `awalidoc/Doxygen/html` (relative to the location you executed the `make
  doxygen` command, hence probably `_build/awalidoc/Doxygen/html` relative to 
  the directory where this `README.md` is located).  
  The page `awalidoc/Doxygen/html/index.html` is a good way to start.

- The Python documentation is given as docstring directly in the code and be 
  accessed as usual from the `help(..)` or `..?` built-in features.

- The Cora documentation is given directly in the command line, a good start is:
  ```
    cora help
  ```
